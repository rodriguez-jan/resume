            <p class="Hobbies-text">Tennis is my choice sport for when I want some form of physical activity. My friends convinced me to start playing for the tennis team in my sophmore year in high school. Ever since then I fell in love with the sport and never looked back. I mainly played doubles in my time but I'm up to play singles as well.</p>

            <p class="Hobbies-text">I love all things about video games especially e-sports which has a close space to my heart. The games that I'm most invested into are Dota 2 and Leauge of Legends. One of my most memorable experiences was when I went to Seattle to watch The International in 2017 and lost my voice for cheering on my team.</p>

            <p class="Hobbies-text">Going to the outdoors and exploring nature through hiking is one of my favorite past times. I find that the best place for me to reflect about my life and my actions is in deep nature. It is through hiking where I can genuinely disconnect from all of my problems and ask myself about what really matters to me.</p>

That is why the most important value that I hold myself to is to partake in meaningful work.

Stoicism has taught me that to be my best self I must focus on only what I can control, practice what I fear, and to love the experience along the way.</p>
